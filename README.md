A typing game created for Software Development Methods and Tools.

Currently in the requirements phase of development.

The final game will hopefully include:
- Multiuser play
- Exciting graphics
- Variable difficulty texts
- Broad selection of texts

To run locally:
-----
- `sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev sqlite3`
- `sudo gem install bundler`
- `bundle install`
- `rails server`
